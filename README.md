# Tic Tac Toe with reinforcement learning (RL) agent
Implementation of game of tic-tac-toe with reinforcement learning agent.

### Implementation
1. First use [Ogre3D](https://www.ogre3d.org/) for front end and interfacing and C++ for backend and RL agent.
2. After successful implementation of step 1, use Node.js for front end and visualizing the game and interaction. Hence increase reachability to users.
3. For back end processing of the game use a C++ codebase (reuse the implementation from step 1) i.e [webassembly](https://webassembly.org/) with [node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webassembly).
