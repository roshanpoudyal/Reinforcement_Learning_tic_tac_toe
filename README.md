### Tic Tac Toe with reinforcement learning (RL) agent
Implementation of game of tic-tac-toe with reinforcement learning agent.

##### Implementation
1. First use [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) for front end & interfacing and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for backend and RL agent logic.
    - You might feel the need for [react-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) during development.
    - Also [react-redux](https://redux.js.org/basics/usage-with-react) could be useful. Look here for [Why use redux?](https://blog.logrocket.com/why-use-redux-reasons-with-clear-examples-d21bffd5835).
    - Look for npm packages for react, react-native and react-redux.
2. After step 1, transfer the RL agent logic from node.js to a C++ codebase (reuse the implementation from step 1), using [webassembly](https://webassembly.org/) with [node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webassembly).

2. [Resources on web assembly from MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly).
3. [Getting started with web assembly from webassembly official website](https://webassembly.org/getting-started/developers-guide/).

##### Resources on implementation of tic-tac-toe

##### Resources on AI and Machine Learning in general
1. Great resources on AI and Machine Learning from [Siraj Raval](http://www.youtube.com/c/sirajraval) in his [github repositories](https://github.com/llSourcell?tab=repositories).

##### Future directions :
1. Apply reinforcement learning algorithm on other games. 
    - Maybe make use of [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) to get the environments or games where you can apply your reinforcement learning algorithms. [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. It supports teaching agents everything from walking to playing games like Pong or Pinball.
